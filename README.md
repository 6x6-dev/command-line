# Command Line

create a command line application.

## Requirements

- offer the user a command they can use in their terminal.
- user interaction (parsing arguments is interaction).

that is all.

## Notes

If you choose to create this in Node js, some useful frameworks are [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) and [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander). Rust appears to have some interesting [tools available](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/cli). [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) looks like a cool option if you want to use Golang. Python also has some cool options with [click](https://github.com/pallets/click) and [docopt](http://docopt.org/)

## Examples
